<p>The bottom (or beauty) quark is a third-generation quark with a charge of -1/3. It has a huge mass (around 4.2 GeV/c^2 - the protons mass is 0.938 GeV/c^2). The bottom quark is notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays, and is a frequent decay product for the Higgs boson.

<h5><b>History of the discovery</b></h5>
<p>
The bottom quark was theorized in 1973 by physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa to explain CP violation. The name "bottom" was introduced in 1975 by Haim Harari. The bottom quark was discovered in 1977 by the Fermilab E288 experiment team led by Leon M. Lederman, when collisions produced bottomonium. Kobayashi and Maskawa won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for their explanation of CP-violation. On its discovery, there were efforts to name the bottom quark "beauty", but "bottom" became the predominant usage.
